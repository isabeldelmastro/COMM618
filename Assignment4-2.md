How has immigration by non-US citizens to South Carolina changed since Donald Trump took office? From which countries do immigrants living in South Carolina tend to immigrate in 2025, and how does this compare to data from the past five years?

I hypothesize that immigration by non-US citizens to South Carolina has dramatically decreased since Donald Trump took office, and that the majority of immigrants in South Carolina come from Mexico.. I would need data containing the number of immigrants to South Carolina each year starting from 2020. I would also need data that shows their country of origin.

Collecting this data might ultimately fail, but I know I have a few starting points. The most recent data available regarding immigration to South Carolina [comes from the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce] (https://www.dew.sc.gov/labor-market-information-blog/2025-05/2024-population-estimates-migration-drives-rapid-growth-south) citing data from 2024. However, the data cites domestic migration, which encompasses all people migrating to South Carolina. I could ask if they have demographic specific migration data collected from 2025, but this might be a stretch. 

I could send a FOIA request to the United States Census Bureau to obtain records regarding demographic specific immigrant populations entering South Carolina since 20120, but there is no guarantee that they collected this data.

There are advocacy groups that may have this data collected that has yet to be published. The American Civil Liberties Union [collected data] (https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/south-carolina/) regarding South Carolina's immigrant populations in 2023, but there is no update from 2024 and 2025. 

I would have to be very lucky to obtain data from an advocacy group before it's published. Ultimately, I might have to find a way to obtain the data myself. To be honest, I am not sure how I would go about this, as immigrants are now more hesitant than ever to give away their personal information. I could partner up with an advocacy group to strategize ways to collect this data.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WLrtWKqNbMkeDEcOi0EUk6DvPPsqvp-ogs2zb6yq5wg/edit?usp=sharing) is how I would organize my data. I would also calculate the percent change in immigration populations in South Carolina over time for each demographic.

There is a real possibility that demographic-specific immigration data for South Carolina is nonexistent. Therefore, I might need to adjust my focus from the country of origin to the region of origin. For example, I would collect/find data regarding how many Latinos vs Europeans vs Africans immigrated to South Carolina since 2015. This is not ideal, but it might be my only option if the country-by-country data does not exist.
