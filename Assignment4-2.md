How has immigration by non-US citizens to South Carolina changed since Donald Trump took office? Which country do immigrants living in South Carolina immigrate from in 2025, and how does this compare to data from the past five years?

I hypothesize that immigration by non-US citizens to South Carolina has dramatically decreased since Donald Trump took office. I would need data containing the number of non-US citizens who immigrated to South Carolina each year starting since 2020. I would like demographic data on the country of origin of those who immigrated to South Carolina.

In order to collect this data, I have a few options. The most recent data available regarding immigration to South Carolina comes from the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce citing data from 2024. I could ask if they have data collected from 2025.

I could send a FOIA request to the United States Census Bureau to obtain records regarding immigrant populations entering South Carolina since 2015, but there is no guarantee that they collected this data.

There are advocacy groups that may have this data collected but not published. The American Civil Liberties Union collected data regarding South Carolina's immigrant populations in 2023, but there is no update for 2024 and 2025. They may have this data that isn’t published.

I would have to be very lucky to obtain data from an advocacy group without it being published, so I would have to find a way to obtain it myself. To be honest, I am not sure how I would go about this, as immigrants are more hesitant now than ever to give away their personal information. I could partner up with an advocacy group to strategize ways to collect this data.

Here is how I would organize my data. I would also calculate the percent change in immigration populations in South Carolina over time for each demographic.

There is a real possibility that demographic-specific immigration data for South Carolina is nonexistent. Therefore, I might need to adjust my focus from the country of origin to the region. For example, I would collect data regarding how many Latinos vs Europeans vs Africans immigrated to South Carolina since 2015. This is not ideal, but it might be my only option if the data does not exist.
