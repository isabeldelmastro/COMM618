**Isabel Del Mastro's Final Project Pitch**
I found a [master dataset](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download) from the FAA that details records of all U.S. Civil Aircraft maintained by the FAA. I am going to synthesize this data set to track all of the aircraft owned and registered by ICE contractors and subcontractors (CSI Aviation, Global Crossing Airlines, Eastern Air Express) from the last five years, documenting the N-number, date it was registered, and company that registered it. If I find that agregating this data is is too ambitious, I may focus on the last five years. Then, I will document flight departures and arrivals for as many aircraft as I can using a flight log tracker like ADS-B or Open Sky. 

With this data, I would like to explore the number of aircraft frequently flying to and from countries where ICE is deporting immigrants. I believe that with a little more research, I can also determine with some level of accuracy the number of flights used for deportations by known ICE Aviation Subcontractors. I would like to compare this data across the past five years in hopes I can give an accurate numerical growth to:
  A) the number of aircraft the number of aricraft that known ICE aviation contractors and subcontractors are flying to and from deporation hubs.
  B) The number of aircraft used for deportations by known ICE aviation contractors and subcontractors.

  Discovering a will be easier than discovering b, as it will be difficult to discern with certainty which flights are used for deportation purposes. However, I believe that testing my hypothesis that there is a quantifiable increase of airplanes (owned by known ICE contractors and subcontractors) traveling to countries where immigrants are being deported.
