**Assignment 4.1**

*The ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) conducts yearly inspections in to ICE detention facilities to make sure that detainees are being provided proper medical care. These records can only be accessed through FOIA, but as detenion oversight has been heavily criticized and overhauled throughout 2025, the reports are incredibly valuable to monitor how ICE is overseeing and treating medical care.*

*I used MuckRock to draft my request. Here is the text they used below.*

To whom it may concern,

Pursuant to the {law name} I hereby request the following records:

The ICE Health Service Corps detenion facility annual report of Stewart Detention Facility for the Fiscal Year of 2025.

{waiver}

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charge in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by email if avaiable.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to recieving your request within {days}.

Sincerely,

Isabel Del mastro
