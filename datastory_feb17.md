[South Carolina tops nation as fastest-growing state](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2026/01/28/south-carolina-population-growth-census/88384568007/)

I think this story could have a lot of potential. South Carolina growing faster than any other state is intersting, but I wish they would have compared that growth to other states. A 1.5 percent population incrase isn't that interesting unless it dramatically outpaces other states. I also don't think it's fair to compare the population growth of the united states to the population growth of South Carolina, as the population sizes are so different from one anther.
THe same goes for the statement "The Upstate — especially Greenville and Spartanburg counties — has outpaced state and national growth trends." The growth percentages that they cite of Spartanburg County (2.9%) and Greenville (2%) is not that newsworthy. As an average reader, I wonder why the reporter thought those datapoints would be relevant to include.
