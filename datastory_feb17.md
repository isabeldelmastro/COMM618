[South Carolina tops nation as fastest-growing state](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/2026/01/28/south-carolina-population-growth-census/88384568007/)

I think this story has potential, but it ultimately missed the mark. I think it's interesting that South Carolina grew faster than any other state, but a 1.5 population increase isn't that newsworthy, unless it is dramatically different from other states. I also don't think it's fair to compare the population growth of the United States to the population growth of South Carolina because their population sizes are so different.

I would give similar critiques to the statement "The Upstate — especially Greenville and Spartanburg counties — has outpaced state and national growth trends."  Spartanburg and Greeville County's percentage growth is not that newsworthy. As an average reader, I wonder why the reporter thought those datapoints would be relevant to include.
