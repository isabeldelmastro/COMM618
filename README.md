# What I found interesting about the data
I found it interesting that only 4 classmates ranked their familiarity with Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets as a "4" or "very familiar." I would have expected more people to feel very confident with excel, as many students in this class probably used spreadsheets to report in other classes or at internships.

I also found it interesting tha tthere were 6 people in the class that ranked their Excel and Google Sheets familiarity as a "2" or a "1," for the same reasons.

There is a chart within my tab, [Isabel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJuBV_QxyBpBbxHRO3dGrs_aa06kEBOg1s_ZGOMqr78/edit?gid=329789966#gid=329789966) , that shows you the data.
