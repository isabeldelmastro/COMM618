[Four years of war. 200,000 confirmed dead and the geography of Russian losses in the war with Ukraine](https://en.zona.media/article/2026/02/24/mapofwar)

I think this is a fantastic data story. The amount of work that has gone into collecting data surrounding deaths during the war in Ukraine is impressive, as it pulls data from Russia's background check services, Manticore to obtain death certificates. From that, they were able to independently verify 23,000 new fatalities by matching them to records.

I also like how this database tries to map names of fatalities to their hometowns. I appreciate taht they noted that even though the majority of fatalities were matched to urban hometowns, the data could be skewed — Those that live in urban areas are more likely to have an online footpring, and are therefore easy to attract.
