**Virginian motor-vehicle accidents plummeted as thier fatalities soared in 2020**

Virginia saw a 17.6% record drop in vehicular crashes in 2020, yet their fatalities were at an all-time high: that year, 847 people died in vehicular accidents.

The pandemic was Virginia's most fatal year in motor-vehicle accidents since 2007, in which the state saw 1,026 vehicular fatalities. 

(Insert an expert opinion that can analyze the data in relation to the pandemic and explain why fatalities increased in Virginia)

The increase in vehicular fatalities is not exclusive to Virginia. Despite Americans driving less in 2020, fatalities increased by 7.2% across the nation, according to a [report](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic) by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 

Virginians also drove less in 2020: approximately 12 thousand less people drove during the first year of the pandemic compared to 2019.

(Expert quote that can relate the American statistics to the Virginian statistics).

Conversely, the number of injuries caused by vehicular accidents did not increase with fatalities in 2020. Similar to the number of vehicular crashes, the number of injuries plummeted by almost 20%.

Property damage accidents also decreased significantly in 2020. (Here I need to confirm with an expert opinion that property damage accidents are accidents that do not have injuries or fatalities. Then I will put the percentage decrease.)
