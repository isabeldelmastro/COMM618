Good evening,

I am curious about the flooding in Charleston, South Carolina — my hometown. Charleston has had major flooding issues for as long as I can remember. My question is: How has flooding in Charleston, South Carolina, changed over the past 10 years? Which month tends to have the most instances of flooding?

Here is my dataset: https://www.weather.gov/chs/coastalflood 

This is a valuable data set because it spans back to 1921. It includes the number of floods that occurred during every month of each year. Furthermore, it specifies which region of Charleston the data comes from: The Charleston Harbor. The dataset also shows calculations of the top ten years and the top ten months with the most flooding. 

The data raises a few questions for me: What has caused flooding in Charleston to occur more often within the past 20 years? How high is the flooding typically when it occurs? Has the height of flooding increased with the number of flood instances?

This data comes from the National Weather Service. To be honest, I did not need to do much vetting to verify that the National Weather Service was a reliable source. It is a service that collects data about the weather from cities, counties, and states across the USA, which news outlets have cited in the past.
