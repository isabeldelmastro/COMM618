**Number of Americans who expect ‘high quality lives’ drops to two-decade low**

For today's data story, I chose an article by the Washington Post, (Number of Americans who expect ‘high quality lives’ drops to two-decade low) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2026/02/10/americans-optimism-poll/]

This story pulls data from a survey conducted by Gallup, whose been measuring optimism in Americans since 2008. Their findings found that 6 in 10 people said they expected their lives would be better in the future — about nine percentage points lower than 2020 (the height of the COVID pandemic)

The story also notes optimism has declined the most in hispanic adults.

I find this story incredibly compelling for personal reasons. I have found amongst my friends and I that our optomism about our futures has dropped significantly since the beginning of the academic year, so I found it interesting that data conducted by Gallup in some ways reflects our declining sense of optimism. I would love to see how Gallup conducted their survey, including the sample size they pulled from and the percentage breakdown of each demographic group that responded to the survey.
